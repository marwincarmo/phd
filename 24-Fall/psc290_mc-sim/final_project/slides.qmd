## Background {#background}

- The SS-MELSM is a method to identify clusters (such as students, classrooms, schools, etc.) that display
unusual amounts of residual variability. 
 
- The MELSM allows the simultaneous estimation of a model for the means (location) and a model for the residual variance (scale).
 
- The spike and slab prior serves as Bayesian regularization technique to shrink random effects to their fixed effect.
  
## Motivation

- SS-MELSM can be implemented with the `ivd` package for `R`.

- The model was illustrated with a real dataset of 160 schools and 11,386 students.

- **Goal**: Determine the minimum sample size and observations per cluster needed for stable estimates of scale random effects standard deviation.
  
## Data generating mechanism

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:model-1}
\begin{aligned}
y_{ij} & \sim  \mathcal{N}(\mu_j, \sigma_j)\\
\mu_j &= \gamma_{0} + u_{0j}\\
\sigma_j &= \exp(\eta_{0} + t_{0j}).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \textbf{v}=
  \begin{bmatrix} u_0 \\ t_0 \end{bmatrix} \sim \mathcal{N}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \boldsymbol{0}=
        \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix},
        \boldsymbol{\Sigma}=
        \begin{bmatrix} \tau^2_{u_0} & \tau_{u_0t_0} \\ 
                        \tau_{u_0t_0} & \tau^2_{t_0} 
        \end{bmatrix}
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

## Simulation design

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:model-1b}
\begin{aligned}
y_{ij} & \sim  \mathcal{N}(\mu_j, \sigma_j)\\
\mu_j &= 0 + u_{0j}\\
\sigma_j &= \exp(0 + t_{0j}).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \textbf{v}=
  \begin{bmatrix} u_0 \\ t_0 \end{bmatrix} \sim \mathcal{N}
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \boldsymbol{0}=
        \begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix},
        \boldsymbol{\Sigma}=
        \begin{bmatrix} 0.1089 & -0.0039 \\ 
                        -0.0039 & 0.0081 
        \end{bmatrix}
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

$\Sigma$ is estimated from a real dataset included in `ivd` as `saeb`.

---

- The number of schools and students were set to reflect realistic data structures:
  - Rural areas, urban areas, or national assessments.

- All models were fitted with four chains of 2,000 iterations and 8,000 warm-up samples.

- Each scenario was replicated 100 times.

- `R` 4.4.2 was used for the analyses.

- Metrics of Bias, MSE, and coverage were computed.

## Results

- Total runtime was approximately 20 hours.

- Scenario 8 could not be estimated due to exceeding the memory limit (>64GB).

- The convergence rate across all scenarios was about 80%.

### Number of schools with unnusual residual variability

### Efficiency metrics

![](efficiency.png)

::: {.notes}
- R-hat measures convergence in MCMC sampling; an R-hat value close to 1 indicates that chains have likely converged, meaning the samples are representative of the posterior distribution.

- The ESS estimates the number of independent samples in correlated MCMC chains, with a higher ESS suggesting a more reliable and efficient representation of the posterior.
:::

## Conclusion

- `ivd` tends to estimate upwardly biased estimates of scale random effects standard deviation

- The bias in estimates decreases when there are more than 50 schools.

- With 200 or more schools, even 30 students per cluster seem sufficient for less biased estimates.

- The number of units with PIP > 0.75  is more influenced by the student-to-school ratio than by total observations.

- While $\hat{R}$ values and Effective Sample Size (ESS) were acceptable, smaller sample sizes require more MCMC samples for accuracy.
