# Metrics -----------------------------------------------------------------

# Capture Key Metrics: Record posterior means, credible intervals, and PIPs, 
# focusing on how well the model can recover the true parameters across 
# varying sample sizes and cluster sizes.


# Evaluate Model Recovery and Accuracy ------------------------------------

# Parameter Recovery: Compare estimated parameters to the known true values from the simulations. 
# Track:
#   Bias: Check if estimates systematically deviate from true values.
#   Coverage: Confirm if the credible intervals for parameters cover the true 
#   values at an acceptable rate (e.g., 95%).
# Inclusion Probabilities: Evaluate the modelâ€™s ability to accurately identify 
# clusters with high variance (if applicable in your simulation setup).
# Effective Sample Size: For each scenario, assess the effective sample sizes 
# and model convergence metrics (e.g., R-hat) to identify the minimum data 
# requirements for reliable estimates. Number of burnin and iterations?
# 
# Minimum Data Requirements: Determine the minimum sample size and observations 
# per cluster needed for stable parameter estimates and high inclusion accuracy,
# and document where model performance starts to decline.
