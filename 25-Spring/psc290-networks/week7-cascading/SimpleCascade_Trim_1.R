# Cascading Failure concept by Watts (2002)
# Intellectual property of Jonathan J. Park, PhD @UC Davis

## The logic of this failure system is that neighbors are tolerant to failures of their neighbors
## If enough of your neighbors fail, you will too
### Failure thresholds for each $i^{th}$ individual (\phi_i) are assumed to be random
### They are drawn from a uniform distribution from e.g., 0.10 - 0.20
### Thus, if 10- to 20-percent of neighbors fail, you will too
