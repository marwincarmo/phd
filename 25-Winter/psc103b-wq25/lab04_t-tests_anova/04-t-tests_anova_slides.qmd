## Today's dataset

We can access this dataset by installing the `palmerspenguins` package.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(palmerpenguins)
```

```{r}
dplyr::glimpse(penguins)
```

## Today's dataset

![Bill dimensions](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/reference/figures/culmen_depth.png)

## Two-Sample t-test

-   Outcome variable: `bill_length_mm`

-   Not all penguins gave data on bill length and there are some missing values.

-   The `complete.cases()` function gives the row numbers where there is non-missing values on the variable you give it.

::: fragment
```{r}
penguins_subset <- penguins[complete.cases(penguins$bill_length_mm),]
```
:::

## Two-Sample t-test

-   Suppose we were interested in whether male penguins or female penguins had different bill lengths.

-   We suspected that male penguins have longer bill lengths than female penguins.

-   Let's look at both means

::: fragment
```{r}
# Average bill lenght for males
mean(penguins_subset$bill_length_mm[penguins_subset$sex == "male"],
     na.rm = TRUE)

# Average bill lenght for females
mean(penguins_subset$bill_length_mm[penguins_subset$sex == "female"],
     na.rm = TRUE)
```
:::

## Two-Sample t-test

-   Another way to do this is to use the `tapply()` function.

-   `tapply(variable, group, function, extra arguments for the function)`

::: fragment
```{r}
tapply(penguins_subset$bill_length_mm, 
       penguins_subset$sex, mean, na.rm = TRUE)
```
:::

## Two-Sample t-test

-   Is the numerical difference of \~4 mm actually significant?

-   $H_0: \mu_{female} = \mu_{male}$, or the average bill length of females is the **same** as the average bill length of males.

-   $H_1: \mu_{female} < \mu_{male}$, or the average bill length of females is **less** than that of males.

-   The t-test is trying to see whether the difference you observed between the groups is large given the expected variability of that difference across samples.

## Two-Sample t-test

-   Our hypothesis was that females have shorter bill lengths than males.

-   `R` views the females as Group 1 and males as Group 2 (because female is alphabetically before male). We need to decide our alternative with Group 1 compared to Group 2.

::: fragment
```{r}
levels(penguins_subset$sex)
```
:::

## Now you try

-   Using the following syntax, replace the placeholders with the names of the variables weâ€™re interested in:

:::: fragment
```{r eval=FALSE}
t.test(dependent_variable ~ group_variable, data = dataset,
       alternative = "???")
```

::: callout-tip
## Tip

The argument `alternative` specifies the alternative hypothesis and can take any of these three values: `"two.sided"`, `"less"`, or `"greater"`. Think about our hypothesis to choose one of the alternatives.
:::
::::

## Now you try

```{r }
t.test(bill_length_mm ~ sex, data = penguins_subset, alternative = "less")
```

## Write-up the results

> The Welch Two Sample t-test found that female penguins (M = 42.1, SD = 4.90) have, on average, shorter bill lenghts than male penguins (M = 45.9, SD = 5.37), t(329.29) = -6.67, *p* \< .001.

## Before we move on...

-   Notice that `R` gives us the Welch's t-test by default.

-   It is used when the number of samples in each group is different, and the variance of the two data sets is also different. Usually, that is a safe assumption.

-   To assume equal variances, set the argument `var.equal = TRUE`.

# One-Way ANOVA

## One-Way ANOVA

-   What should we do if we have more than two groups we are interested in comparing?

-   Our question is the same as a t-test - are there differences in the average score across the groups? We can't use a t-test because a t-test is **limited to 2 groups**.

-   Running multiple t-tests increases our Type 1 error rate - the probability of finding a significant difference when there is none.

-   One-way ANOVA lets us examine whether **multiple groups** differ in average scores.

## One-Way ANOVA

-   Let us apply this to the example of whether bill length differs across the different species of penguins.

-   $H_0: \mu_{Adelie} = \mu_{Chinstrap} = \mu_{Gentoo}$ or in other words, the average bill length is the same for all 3 species of penguins. The alternative hypothesis is:

-   $H_A$: At least one of the means is different, or $H_0$ is not true.

## One-Way ANOVA

-   The alternative hypothesis is a bit more complicated. It can be that:
    -   $\mu_{Adelie} \neq \mu_{Chinstrap} = \mu_{Gentoo}$ or,
    -   $\mu_{Adelie} = \mu_{Chinstrap} \neq \mu_{Gentoo}$ or,
    -   $\mu_{Adelie} \neq \mu_{Chinstrap} \neq \mu_{Gentoo}$,
    -   etc.
-   To capture all those possibilities, we need an alternative hypothesis that is a bit more vague ($H_0$ is not true, or at least one mean is different).

## One-Way ANOVA

-   What can you say by looking at this plot?

::: fragment
```{r echo=FALSE}
#| fig-align: "center"
ggplot(data = penguins_subset, aes(x = species, y = bill_length_mm, fill = species))+
  geom_boxplot()+
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = TRUE, alpha = 0.6)+
  geom_jitter(color = "black", size = 0.4)+
  labs(x = "Species", y = "Bill Length")+
  theme_light()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  geom_hline(yintercept = mean(penguins_subset$bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE))
```
:::

## One-Way ANOVA

-   On face value, the means of the groups are different, but there is also a lot of variability within each group around that group mean.

-   ANOVA quantifies how much variation we see between groups is due to actual, significant group differences and how much is just due to sampling variation.

## One-Way ANOVA

-   If $H_0$ were true, we would expect the amount of variance due to individual differences to be larger than the amount of variance that is due to group differences

-   If $H_0$ **were not true**, and there were actual group differences, then we expect the variation between groups to be larger than the residual variance (which is the variance due to sampling error/non-group differences).

## One-Way ANOVA

We can compare between and within groups variability with the F-ratio:

$$
\begin{aligned}
F &= \frac{\text{Between groups variability}}{\text{Within groups variability}}\\
&= \frac{\text{Group effects + Ind diffs + Error}}{\text{Ind diffs + Error}}
\end{aligned}
$$

If the group effect is zero, F-ratio will be close to one.

## Computing the F-ratio

$$
F = \frac{MS_{Between}}{MS_{Within}} = \frac{\frac{SS_{Between}}{df_{Between}}}{\frac{SS_{Within}}{df_{Within}}}
$$ Let's walk through an example.

## Between-Group Variance

-   If $H_0$ were true, then our best guess for the score of a new penguin would be the **grand mean** (or the mean of the entire sample), since group membership wouldn't tell us anything useful.

-   We can compare each group's mean to this grand mean.

-   If the group means are all similar, then the variance will be small.

-   If the group means are different, then the variance will be large.

## Between-Group Variance

-   First, let us calculate the mean of each group.

-   How would you do it in `R`?

::: fragment
```{r}
tapply(penguins_subset$bill_length_mm, penguins_subset$species, mean,
       na.rm = TRUE)
```
:::

## Between-Group Variance

We can make a dataframe that contains the group means and the grand means, to make it easier to calculate the $SS_{Between}$.

```{r}
penguin_means <- data.frame(
  GroupMean = tapply(penguins_subset$bill_length_mm, 
                     penguins_subset$species, mean, 
                     na.rm = TRUE), 
  GrandMean = mean(penguins_subset$bill_length_mm, 
                               na.rm = TRUE))

penguin_means
```

## Between-Group Variance

::: {.callout-caution title="Exercise"}
Create a new column in `penguin_means` named `mean_deviations` containing the difference between each group mean and the grand mean.
:::

::: fragment
```{r}
penguin_means$mean_deviations <- penguin_means$GroupMean - penguin_means$GrandMean

penguin_means
```
:::

## Between-Group Variance

-   The mean deviations do not tell us much yet. We are first trying to estimate the $SS_{Between}$

-   If you recall from class, this tell us the variability of group means around the grand mean scaled by group sample size:

::: fragment
$$
\begin{aligned}
SS_{Between} &= \sum^k_{j=1}n_j(\bar{X_j}-\bar{X})^2\\
             &= n_{1}(\bar{X}_{1}-\bar{X})^2 + n_{2}(\bar{X}_{2}-\bar{X})^2 + n_{3}(\bar{X}_{3}-\bar{X})^2
\end{aligned}
$$
:::

## Between-Group Variance

-   So, before we can square the deviations and add them, we need to multiply it by the corresponding group sample size.

-   To get the size of each group, we can use the `table()` function.

::: fragment
```{r}
table(penguins_subset$species)
```

```{r}
penguin_means$SampleSize <- table(penguins_subset$species)
```
:::

::: fragment
```{r}
SSB <- sum(penguin_means$mean_deviations^2 * penguin_means$SampleSize)
SSB
```
:::

## Within-Group Variance

-   Now we need to calculate $SS_{Within}$, or the residual variance, the difference from each individual's score to their group's mean.

-   To calculate this, we need to get each penguin's observation and each penguin's group mean in the same dataframe.

-   One way to do this is create smaller vectors for each species.

::: fragment
```{r}
penguins_adelie <- penguins_subset$bill_length_mm[penguins_subset$species == "Adelie"]

penguins_chinstrap <- penguins_subset$bill_length_mm[penguins_subset$species == "Chinstrap"]

penguins_gentoo <- penguins_subset$bill_length_mm[penguins_subset$species == "Gentoo"]
```
:::

## Within-Group Variance

::: {.callout-caution title="Exercise"}
Calculate the sum of squared deviations from the group mean separately for each group, and save them in three different objects: `penguins_adelie_dev`, `penguins_chinstrap_dev`, and `penguins_gentoo_dev`.
:::

::: callout-tip
Note that we have to use `na.rm = TRUE` twice: one to calculate the value of the mean, but also to use the `sum()` function since not all penguins have a bill length, so using `mean()` or `sum()` on something with a `NA` value leads to a `NA`.
:::

Here's what you're calculating: $SS = \sum(X_i - \bar{X})$

## Within-Group Variance

```{r}
penguins_adelie_dev <- sum((penguins_adelie - 
                             mean(penguins_adelie, na.rm = TRUE))^2, na.rm = TRUE)

penguins_chinstrap_dev <-  sum((penguins_chinstrap - 
                                mean(penguins_chinstrap, na.rm = TRUE))^2, na.rm = TRUE)

penguins_gentoo_dev <- sum((penguins_gentoo - 
                             mean(penguins_gentoo, na.rm = TRUE))^2, na.rm = TRUE)
```

And now we add up all these deviations to get `SSW`

```{r}
SSW <- penguins_adelie_dev + penguins_chinstrap_dev + penguins_gentoo_dev

SSW
```

## ANOVA Calculation

-   Now that we have `SSB` and `SSW`, we need to get the df for each variance.

-   The formulas for the df are:

::: fragment
$df_{between} = k - 1$

$df_{within} = N -k - 1$
:::

-   where $k$ is the number of groups and $N$ is the total sample size.

## ANOVA Calculation

-   We know we have 3 groups, but how many penguins?

::: fragment
```{r}
nrow(penguins_subset)
```

```{r}
dfB <- 3 - 1
dfW <- 342 - 3
```
:::

-   Now we can calculate Mean Squared Between and Mean Squared Within by dividing each sum of squares by the df.

::: fragment
```{r}
MSB <- SSB / dfB
MSW <- SSW / dfW
```
:::

## ANOVA Calculation

-   $MS_{Between}$ describes the amount of variance that can be attributed to the differences between groups.

-   $MS_{Within}$ describes the amount of variance that can be attributed to chance or sampling error (basically, whatever cannot be described by group differences).

-   We compare these 2 to calculate our F-statistic.

::: fragment
```{r}
Fstat <-  MSB / MSW
```
:::

## ANOVA Calculation

-   We can get the p-value of F by looking at the F-distribution with degrees of freedom (dfB, dfW).

-   In `R`, this is done using the pf() function.

::: fragment
```{r}
pf(Fstat, df1 = dfB, df2 = dfW, lower.tail = FALSE)
```
:::

## ANOVA Calculation

-   What can we conclude?

-   Since our p-value is less than .05, we would reject $H_0$, and conclude that at least one of the groups have an average bill length that is not equal to the rest.

-   Which species, though, is different?

-   The F-test is an omnibus test, so although it can tell us that there are significant group differences in bill length, it does **not** tell us which groups are different.

-   We find that with post-hoc tests (next week!)

## ANOVA Calculation

-   `R` obviously has a way simpler solution to do the anova.

-   The `aov()` function: `aov(outcome ~ group, data = dataset)`

-   To get meaningful results, we need to wrap the object created by `aov()` around the `summary()` function:

::: fragment
```{r}
my_anova <- aov(bill_length_mm ~ species, data = penguins_subset)
summary(my_anova)
```
:::

-   Does this match what we got before? Is our conclusion the same?

## Now you try

::: {.callout-caution title="Exercise"}
Run an One-Way ANOVA using `aov()`to investigate if there is an overall difference in `body_mass_g` between `species` in the `penguins_subset` dataset. What can you conclude?
:::

::: fragment
```{r}
summary(aov(body_mass_g ~ species, data = penguins_subset))
```
:::
