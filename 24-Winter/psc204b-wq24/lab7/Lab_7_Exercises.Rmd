#Section 1: Hand calculation of propensity scores

#Exercise 1: Using 'smoke01',or the label of whether someone smokes or not as the treatment, and sex, race, and marital status married01 as covariates, create a logistic regression model.

mod1 <- glm(smoke01 ~ sex + race + married01, data = arh, family = "binomial")
summary(mod1)
#Exercise 2: Obtain the predicted probabilities from this model and add as a new column to the arh dataset

arh$propensity_scores <- predict(mod1, type="response")

#Exercise 3: Look at some of the propensity scores and write down what they would mean in this context

arh |> 
  dplyr::select(smoke01, sex, race, married01, propensity_scores) |> 
  dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(propensity_scores))

#Here, all subjects that have the combination of covariates female, married, Black/African American have about a 9% chance to be smokers

#Exercise 4: Count the number of people per subgroup (hint: you will use group_by function)

arh |> 
  dplyr::with_groups(c(smoke01, sex, race, married01, propensity_scores),
                     mutate, n = n())

#Exercise 5: Using the filter function, look at the count of smokers and nonsmokers in the male, Black/African American, Married subgroup.

arh |> 
  dplyr::filter(
    sex == "Male",
    race == "Black/African American",
    married01 == "Married"
  )

```{r}
#Section 2: Using MatchIt package to perform a propensity score analysis

#Exercise 1: Perform a linear regression to look at whether people who smoke cigarettes differ from non-smokers on the depression variable



#Exercise 2: Use the nearest neighbor method in MatchIt to calculate propensity scores and propensity score match across individuals.

#summary(match1)

match1 <- matchit(smoke01 ~ depress2001, data=arh)
summary(match1)

#Exercise 3: Perform a linear regression using the matched data
model2 <- lm(depress2001 ~ smoke01)

#Exercise 4: Compare between smoker/nonsmoker group numbers in original versus the matched dataset



#Additional info: take a look at the matched dataset! It contains information about subclasses that are matched, distance, etc.


#Exercise 5: randomize the order of the dataframe and re-run the propensity score analysis above (including the linear regression portion)



#Exercise 6: Use the exact matching method in MatchIt to perform a propensity score analysis (include the linear regression from the new matched data)


#summary(match1)


#Exercise 7: Now perform a weighted regression using the exact matched dataset


#Exercise 8: find which subgroups were excluded in the exact matching data. You will use a number of functions from dplyr including: distinct() which pulls unique values of a combination of columns, mutate() which creates a new column, and pull(), which is similar to $ but works better as part of the %>% pipeline.setdiff() will also be used to find differences between two sets.
