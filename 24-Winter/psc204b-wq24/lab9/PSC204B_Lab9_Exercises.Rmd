This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

#Here is just a useful exercise to show in lab (how does R get its seeds and how could we possibly capture the current seed used?) <- maybe show this after Exercise 1

x <- .Random.seed
result <- rnorm(5)
attr(result, "seed")<-x
x

.Random.seed <- attr(result, "seed")
result2 <- rnorm(5)

result
result2
```
```{r}
#Exercise 1: setting seeds
#[1] run an rnorm for a sample of 1 value using the default settings for mean and standard deviation


#[2] using a for loop, run the rnorm function to sample 1 value as per #1 


#[3] set seed to 12345 and run as per #1


#[4] set seed to 12345 prior to running the for loop and run as per #2



#[5] 'verbal' What did we expect from 4 and what did we actually get from 4?

#[6] create a for loop so that we get the same value for rnorm(1) during each iteration


```
```{r}
#Exercise 2: 'simple distribution simulation’
#[1] use the rnorm() function 3 times for sample sizes of 10 with default mean and sd. Save these each to a variable (e.g., a,b,c)




#[2] use the results from #1 to create a histogram but place all plots in the same row (essentially a 1x3 histogram; hint: we will use par(mfrow)) 




#[3] using rbinom, simulate the following situation: If the probability of a cat landing on its feet is 99%, estimate how many times a cat will land on its feet if you were to test this over 10,000 trials.


#Either way works but they get at slightly different things


#[4] using the two approaches in #3, create two histograms. The first one will show the frequency of success (frequency of 0 or 1) for the situation in #3. The second will require a little extension, but, it will show the distribution of expected successes for the 10,000 trials across 1000 different possibilities. 





#[5] calculate the 95% confidence interval for the particular distribution from #4 (hint: you will use the quantile() function)


```
```{r}
#Exercise 3: simulating samples based on linear regression

#[1] run the linear regression given to you in this portion
lm_fit <- lm(mpg ~ scale(hp) + scale(wt), data = mtcars)
summary(lm_fit)

#[2] using the sim() function and 1000 'trials', estimate coefficients for the lm_fit above and plot the histogram of these coefficients



#[3] using the data generated in #2, find the following: the distribution of differences between the scaled hp and scaled wt coefficients, the mean difference, and the 95% CI for the difference distribution.

#[4] what would you then say about the observed differences in our original lm_fit? (Are they significant?)
```

```{r}
#Exercise 4: bootstrapping
#[1] Create a simple function that will calculate any value squared and output it to the console



#[2] Instead of outputting #1 to the console, use return() to allow the function to be used in the math problem function(3)+2



#[3] Using the swiss dataset (preloaded in R), run the regression model provided for this section.Plot the regression.
 
swiss_model<-lm(Fertility~Agriculture,data=swiss)
summary(swiss_model)

#[4] Obtain the confidence interval for the model using the confint() function. Plot the confidence interval simply by setting se=T in the geom_smooth above


#[5] create a function that will be used for boot. To do this, you will need a function that takes two inputs: data, and a subscript variable (you can use i). 

#You will also need the following within the function: specify your x and y variables for the regression but allow these to be indexed by i (these are the Agriculture and Fertility columns; example index: variable1[i]). 

#Specify the linear regression equation using these x and y variables, and finally, indicate the parameter we want to return. Here let's say we want to return the slope parameter (make sure to specify the coefficient of slope within the model)



#[6] use the boot function to generate the bootstrapped parameter from #5 and then use the boot.ci function to geenerate the 95% confidence interval for these



#[7] let's generalize the function in #5 and return all model coefficients instead of just the slope.Run the bootstrap from 6 but extract the confidence interval for just intercept



#[8] I don’t know if we’ll have much time: plot 100 of the linear regressions generated in the bootstrapping and compare to the original plot and the original plot’s CI. (use linetype=’dashed’ in the geom_abline function to help R chug out this plot)
                               
                                                                        
```
