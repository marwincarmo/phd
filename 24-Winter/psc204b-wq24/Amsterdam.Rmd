# Amsterdam Data:

```{r}
age <- c(56, 57, 58, 61, 63, 72, 73, 75, 76, 83)
educ <- c( 9, 13, 11,  9, 12,  8, 10,  8, 11, 12)	
ps <- c(25, 34, 31, 19, 38, 21, 23, 16, 18, 17)

# Design Matrix, comprisign: intercept, age, education
X <- cbind(rep(1,10), age, educ)
solve( t(X) %*% X ) %*% t(X) %*% ps

## with lm()
fit <- lm( ps ~ age + educ )
summary(fit)

```

Mean center predictors `age` and `educ` and re-fit the model
```{r}

age_c <- age - mean(age)
educ_c <- educ - mean(educ)

fit_c <- lm( ps ~ age_c + educ_c )
summary(fit_c)
```
