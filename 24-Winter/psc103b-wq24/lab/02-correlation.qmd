## Read in Data

For today's class, we're going to use a fake dataset that I created looking at the relation between temperature (in Fahrenheit), ice cream sales, and pool accidents .

```{r}
#| echo: true
icecream <- read.csv("data/IceCreamSales.csv")
```


## Running Cod 

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
