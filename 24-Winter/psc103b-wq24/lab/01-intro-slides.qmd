## R as a calculator

### Common mathematic operations in R:

-   `+` : addition
-   `-` : subtraction
-   `/` : division
-   `*` : multiplication
-   `^` : exponent
-   `sqrt()` : square root
-   `exp()` : exponential function

## R as a calculator


```{r, echo = T}
2 + 2

3 - 1

2 * 6

4 / 2

sqrt(16)
```


## R as a calculator

-   To run a line of code just use CTRL + ENTER (that's COMMAND + ENTER if you're on a Mac)

-   How would I ask R to divide 10 by 2?

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
10 / 2
```
:::

-   How would I ask R to calculate 5 to the 4th power?

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
5^4
```
:::

## R as a calculator

The R Calculator follows the PEMDAS rule:

Parentheseis, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subraction from left to right

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
3 + 4 * 12
```
:::

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
(3 + 4) * 12
```
:::

## Commenting

-   Anything that you type after the "\#" will be disregarded by R
-   You can make notes to yourself and it will not interfere with your code

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
# This is a comment to my code
1 + 1
```
:::

## Creating Objects

-   We use objects to store any kind of information in R
-   Think of an object as a label for a piece of information
-   We can save information as variables by using the assignment operator: `<-` or `=`
-   General pattern:

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
a <- 2 + 2
```
:::

-   Now we can access this piece of information by 'calling' `a`

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
a 
```
:::

## Creating Objects

-   R is case sensitive

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T, eval=FALSE}
A
# Error: object 'A' not found
```
:::

-   Objects can be overwritten

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
a <- 3
a
```
:::

## Labeling conventions

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Bad

`1a <- 3`

`!a <- 3`

`a! <- 3`
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Better

`a1 <- 3`

`a_object <- 3`

`a.object <- 3`

`aObject <- 3`
:::
:::

# Data Types

## Numeric

```{r, echo = T}
class(18.9)
my_number <- 13
class(my_number)
is.numeric(my_number)
```

## Character

Character data types must be surrounded by quotation marks

```{r, echo = T}
"student"

myFirstCharacter <- "myFirstCharacter"
myFirstCharacter
```

- What happens if you don't surround a character data type with quotation marks?

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T, eval=FALSE}
student
# Error: object 'student' not found
```
:::

- Without quotation marks, R thinks this is an object label.

## Logical

- There are only two options `TRUE` and `FALSE`

- They must be in all caps

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
true <- FALSE
true == TRUE
```
:::

- You could also abbreviate `TRUE` to `T` and `FALSE` to `F` (not recommended)

## Vectors

- Vectors allow saving multiple pieces of information to an object

- The individual values within a vector are called "elements"

- To do this we can use the `c()` function

- This function combines different pieces of information together

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```
:::

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T, eval=FALSE}
(1, 2, 3, 4)
# Error: unexpected ',' in "(1,"
```
:::

## Vectors

- We can save these pieces of information to an object

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
first_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
```
:::

- We can look at this object by calling it through the object label

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
first_vector
```
:::

- Can you guess the class of `first_vector`?

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
class(first_vector)
```
:::

## Vectors

- We saved four pieces of information (four numbers) to the vector

- We can check the number of elements in a vector with the `lenght()` function

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
length(first_vector)
```
:::

- A vector is a **one-dimensional** collection of information 

- All the elements must be the **same type**

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
second_vector <- c(1, 2, 3, "four")
```
:::

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
second_vector
```
:::

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
class(second_vector)
```
:::

## Subsetting vectors

- To pull out one element from a vector that has multiple elements, we need to subset the vector

- Use square brackets `[]` after the label name with the element number we would like to recover inside the brackets

- `myvector[1]`

## Subsetting vectors

- What if I want to pull out the third element from a vector? 

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
second_vector[3]
```
:::

- We can save this as a new object

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
third_element <- second_vector[3]
third_element
```
:::

- We can also pull out multiple elements at once

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
second_vector[c(2, 3, 4)]
```
:::

## Functions in R

- Functions are pre-written pieces of code that accomplish some task

- Rather than writing out the code to do this task, we can call a function by its label and it will complete that task

- Let's say I wanted to calculate the mean (or average) of our numeric vector 

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
(1 + 2 + 3 + 4) / 4 
```
:::

## Functions in R

- What if `first_vector` had 100 numbers not 4? 

- Or what if you had 100 vectors and wanted to calculate the means of each one

- We could use the `sum()` function and the `length()` function 
  - `sum()` will add up all the numbers in a vector
  - `length()` tells you how many elements are in a vector

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
sum(first_vector)/length(first_vector)
```
:::

- Or we could use the `mean()` function 

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
mean(first_vector)
```
:::

## Functions in R

### Arguments

- Arguments are the information we give the function so it can carry out its task

- A function can have multiple arguments

- `functionLabel(argument1, argument2, argument3)` 

- For the `mean()` function, the first argument was the data or the number we wanted the mean of

## Functions in R

- `round()` will round whatever number you give in the first argument

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
round(3.666)
```
:::

- What if I want it to round the number to the second decimal point?

- We can add another argument

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
round(3.666, 2) 
# The second argument tells it how many decimal points to round to
```
:::

## Functions in R

- Each argument has a label

- Sometimes we don't use them for convenience, but it is helpful specially if you're dealing with a function with many arguments

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
round(x = 3.666, digits = 2)
```
:::

- If you use labels, the order of the arguments don't matter

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
round(digits = 2, x = 3.666)
```
:::

## Functions in R

- What happens if we write the digits argument first without the labels?

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
round(2, 3.666)
```
:::

- When you don't use labels, the order **really** matters

- To learn more about a pre-built function and its arguments, type `?function_name()` in the console (e.g., `?round()`) to find the help page of that function

- Or you can press tab once your cursor is within the function parenthesis

## Functions in R

-  Another useful function is `class()`

- The class function will tell you what kind of data type

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
class(first_vector)
class(second_vector)
```
:::

# Data Structures

## Types of data structure

1- Vector

2- Matrix

3- Array

4- Data frame

5- List

## Matrix

- Two-dimensional dataset (has columns and rows) of **one data type**

- `matrix(data, nrow, ncol, byrow)`

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
m <- matrix(data = c(1:6), # The matrix will contain elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
            nrow = 2, # this matrix will have two rows
            ncol = 3, # this matrix will have three columns
            byrow = TRUE) # we fill the elements by the row
m
```
:::

- What happens if you change `byrow = FALSE` ?

## Matrix

- `dim()` tells you the dimension of a matrix

- First element is number of rows, second element is number of columns

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
dim(m)
```
:::

## Matrix

- We can also create a matrix by combining vectors

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
vec1 <- 1:5
vec2 <- 6:10
```
:::

- We can use the `cbind()` function to make each vector their own column in a matrix

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
col_matrix <- cbind(vec1, vec2)
col_matrix
```
:::

## Matrix

- Or we can use the `rbind()` function to make each vector their own row in a matrix

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
row_matrix <- rbind(vec1, vec2)
row_matrix
```
:::

## Data frames

- Allow you to have **multiple** data types

- We can use the `data.frame()` function to create a data frame

- Each argument is a different column

- We can also add labels to each column

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
dat <- 	data.frame(
  schoolyear = c("Freshman", "Sophomore","Freshman"), 
  height = c(152, 171.5, 165), 
  weight = c(81,93, 78),
  age = c(18,20,19)
)
```
:::

## Subsetting Two-Dimensional Objects

- We've used square brackets `[]` to subset vectors 

- We can use square brackets `[]` to subset two-dimensional objects like a matrix or data frame

- `twoDimObject[row#, column#]`

## Subsetting Two-Dimensional Objects

- If I want to subset the element in row 3 and column 2

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
dat[3, 2]
```
:::

- If I want to subset the entire 3rd column

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
dat[, 3]
```
:::

## Subsetting Two-Dimensional Objects

- I could also subset by column name

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
dat[, "weight"] # this subsets all the rows from the weight column

dat[1, "weight"] # this subsets the first row from the weight column
```
:::

- If we just want to subset a column we can use the `$` operator: `twoDimObject$ColumnName`

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
dat$schoolyear
```
:::

# Review of Statistical Concepts

## Central tendency: Mean, Median, and Mode

- These are the 3 **most common** measures of central tendency

- They are used to **describe a distribution of observations** (e.g., all the grades on an exam) in one number that best represents that distribution

- Suppose we asked a bunch of UC Davis students how many hours per week they spent watching Netflix, and how many hours they spent exercising during Winter break:

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
netflix <- c(2, 6, 1, 7, 2, 4, 11, 40, 7, 0, 3, 4, 5, 2, 15)
exercise <- c(2, 2, 6, 2, 12, 45, 8, 3, 2, 6, 4, 0, 1, 3, 0)
```
:::

## Central tendency: Mean, Median, and Mode

- How many observations are in each variable?

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
length(netflix)
length(exercise)
```
:::

- Let's take a look at the average time each student spent on these activities:

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
mean(netflix, na.rm = TRUE) # use the argument na.rm = TRUE to ignore missing values 
mean(exercise, na.rm = TRUE)
```
:::

- Unsurprisingly, students exercised less than they watched netflix, on average.

## Central tendency: Mean, Median, and Mode

- But is the mean a good representation of these data?

- Take a look again at the values and see if you find something odd

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
netflix
exercise
```
:::

- One person is watching Netflix 40h a week

- Another exercised 45h per week

## Central tendency: Mean, Median, and Mode

- When we have **outliers**, sometimes the **median** is a better representation of  the data

- Remember, the median is the **middle value** of your data, after you have ordered it 

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
median(exercise, na.rm = TRUE)
median(netflix, na.rm = TRUE)
```
:::

## Central tendency: Mean, Median, and Mode

- Sometimes, we can't do arithmetic on the data we have

- If we had asked our 15 participants what their favorite flavor of ice cream was, we would not be able to describe that distribution using a mean or a median. We would have to use the **mode**

- The mode is just the most frequent value

## Central tendency: Mean, Median, and Mode

- R doesn't have a function for because it is not very frequently used, so we use the `table()` function

- `table()` gives you the number of times each element shows up in an object

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
table(netflix)
```
:::

- You can use the `sort()` function on the result of the table function to order it

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
sort(table(exercise))
```
:::

## Spread: Variance and Standard Deviation

- Do all the students exercise about the same? Or do some students exercise a lot while others don't?

- How are the observations spread out around the mean or median?

- We're gonna look at two different kinds that are related: **Variance** and **standard deviation**

## Spread: Variance

1. Calculate the mean

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
mean(exercise, na.rm = TRUE)
```
:::

2. Find the distance from each observation to the mean

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
exercise - mean(exercise, na.rm = TRUE)
```
:::

- Let's save that!

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
diffs <- exercise - mean(exercise, na.rm = TRUE)
```
:::

## Spread: Variance

3. Square the differences

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
diffs_sq <- diffs^2
```
:::

4. Sum everything and divide by N-1 

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
sum(diffs_sq)/(length(exercise) - 1)
```
:::

- We can check our answers using `var()`

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
var(exercise, na.rm = TRUE)
```
:::

## Spread: Standard deviation

- To get the **standard deviation**, we just get the square root of the variance:

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
ex_var <- var(exercise, na.rm = TRUE)
sqrt(ex_var)
```
:::

- Or, R has a `sd()` function:

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
sd(exercise, na.rm = TRUE)
```
:::

- We often prefer to use the standard deviation, because its units are the same units of our variable

## Relationships between variables: correlation and covariance

- In our imaginary example, each person gave us two bits of information, exercise and netflix hours

- Let's organize our data into a dataframe to better keep track of it:

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
df <- data.frame(Netflix = netflix, 
                 Exercise = exercise, 
                 stringsAsFactors = FALSE) 
df
```
:::

---

If you are in RStudio, you can look at df by clicking on it, using `View()`, typing it in the console or using functions like `head()` and `tail()`. Can you tell what those do?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
head(df)
```
:::
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
tail(df)
```
:::
:::
:::

---

It's also a good idea to plot your data

- This helps you get a general idea for what your data looks like, and to see if there is anything weird going on

- To make a scatterplot, we can use `plot()` function in R

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
plot(x = df$Netflix, y = df$Exercise)
```
:::

---

We can make our plot look prettier changing the axis labels, and even giving our plot a title

```{r, echo = T}
plot(df$Netflix, df$Exercise, xlab = "Hours Spent Watching Netflix", #changes the x-axis label
     ylab = "Hours Spent Exercising", # changes the y-axis label
     main = "Plot of Time Spent Watching Netflix vs. Exercising over Break") # gives your plot a title
```

## Covariance

- What if we wanted to quantify this relation? We can use the covariance and correlation!

- The **covariance** between two variables is a measure of how the two variables change together

- It only makes sense if there's some connection between the two variables

- It resembles the variance, but instead of squared differences from the mean, we multiply these differences from the mean by each other

## Covariance

1. Get the differences from the mean for each variable:

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
diff_nfx <- df$Netflix - mean(df$Netflix, na.rm = TRUE)
diff_ex <- df$Exercise - mean(df$Exercise, na.rm = TRUE)
# you can check this is right -- the differences will sum to 0 (or very close to it)
sum(diff_ex)
```
:::

2. Multiply them by each other

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
mult_diffs <- diff_nfx * diff_ex
```
:::

## Covariance

3. Sum all these multiplied differences

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
sum_diffs <- sum(mult_diffs, na.rm = TRUE)
```
:::

4. Divide by N - 1

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
cov_NetEx <- sum_diffs/14
cov_NetEx
```
:::

- We see that the covariance is **negative**, indicating that the Netflix and Exercise variables are **inversely related** to each other

## Covariance

- You can verify this yourself by using the cov() function

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
cov_NetEx_2 <- cov(df$Netflix, df$Exercise, use = "complete.obs")
cov_NetEx_2
```
:::

-  For `cov()`, the `use = "complete.obs"` argument acts similarly to `na.rm = TRUE`: it will only use data from people who gave an answer to both Netflix and exercise

## Correlation

- We don't know how strong is this association because covariances have **arbitrary** scales based on the scales of the original variables

-  We don't know how big they could get so we don't know if this value is large or small

- **Correlations** can only range between **-1** and **1**, so they're easier to interpret

## Correlation

- We'll standardize the covariance to get a correlation

- Standardizing in this case means dividing by the variables' standard deviations:

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
sd_N <- sd(df$Netflix, na.rm = TRUE)
sd_E <- sd(df$Exercise, na.rm = TRUE)
```
:::

- We divide the covariance by the product of the variances to get a correlation:

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
cov_NetEx/(sd_N*sd_E)
```
:::

- And we can check this using the cor() function:

::: fragment
```{r, echo = T}
cor(df$Netflix, df$Exercise, use = "complete.obs")
```
:::

---

```{r, echo = T}
cor(df$Netflix, df$Exercise, use = "complete.obs")
```

Since the correlation ranges between -1 and 1, we can say something about the strength of this relation

- Based on some rules of thumb we can say there is a weak negative relation between watching Netflix and exercise

- What is considered strong vs. weak can **depend on the area of research** you're in

- Next week: statistical test to see whether this correlation is significantly different from 0 or not!
