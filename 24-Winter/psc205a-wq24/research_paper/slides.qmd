## Background

- The Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes About Sleep Scale is a widely used tool in clinical and research settings to examine sleep-related thoughts.

- It is composed of 16 items, conformed into a 4-factor structure: (a) consequences of insomnia, (b) worry about sleep, (c) sleep expectations, (d) medication, and a fifth second-order general factor.

- This study aimed to create a Brazilian-Portuguese adaptation of the Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep Scale (DBAS-16), analyzing its factorial structure, reliability, and construct validity. 

## Methods

### Participants

- Participants with and without insomnia were recruited from March 2021 to July 2022 through social media.

- The final sample consisted of 1385 participants, of which 80.78% were female, and 73.51% reported insomnia symptoms. The mean age was 38.39 years (SD = 9.79, range: 18--59). 

## Methods

### Instruments

- Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes About Sleep
