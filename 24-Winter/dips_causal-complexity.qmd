## Definitions for measurement

- Historically, discussions of measurement have revolved around the **representational theory of measurement**:
  - Relationships between empirical and numerical systems.

- Recently, **causality** gained more relevance:
  - The attribute or property that is being measured should *cause* the measurement outcome
  
- Mood -> survey

## Psychometric measurement as causal models

In **LVM** observed variables are measurements of the latent variable with a degree of error. The attribute is causing the measurement outcomes.

- A test or measurement is valid if and only if it measures what it is intended to measure (Borsboom, 2005; Borsboom et al., 2004).

## Minimal causal condition for measurement

- $O$ is a valid measure of $X$ *only if* there is a causal relationship from $X$ to $O$.

- Necessary but not sufficient condition for measurement.

- The minimal causal condition is compatible with further requirements, such as proof that the attribute is in fact quantitative.

## Conceptual ambiguity and causal complexity

- Most psychological concepts are not well-defined (e.g., psychological symptoms). This unclarity makes it harder to understand their causal structure.

- 'Impaired concentration' refers to three phenomena that are causally different:
  - mental blanking;
  - intrusive thoughts;
  - drifting off topic.
  
- The observed variables are *not* caused by impaired concentration but by one of the three other phenomena.

- The minimal causal condition is not satisfied

## Conceptual ambiguity and causal complexity

- A clearer conceptualization of psychological phenomena is hampered by causal complexity.

- The challenge is to distill relatively stable and causally well-behaved variables.

- The focus has been on applying statistical methods to empirical data, without much attention to how phenomena are conceptualized.

- Models based on *current* psychological concepts might oversimplify and misrepresent the causal structure.

## Possible objections

- Factor analysis might be used to show that a symptom consists of one or several phenomena.

- But it is a poor guide to causal structure because different causal structures can explain the data equally well.

- Our current methods are not sufficient to determine how many variables there are and what is the cause of the measurements.


## Implications for psychological measurement

- The minimal causal condition can justify that psychological measurement does not fulfill the requirements for genuine measurement.

- However, the results of psychological measurements are **often useful**:
  - Self-report measures of feelings are better predictors of decisions and actions than economic variables such as SES.
  - Intelligence scores can predict job performance or academic achievement.

- Psychological measurement can be informative and useful for specific purposes.

## Hard vs. Soft measurement

A. **Hard measurement**: measurement as in the physical sciences, metrology, or the philosophy of measurement.

B. **Soft measurement**: data generation by human participants (human individuals putting numbers on things).

- Different from *hard* measurement, in *soft* measurement we don't know the causal structure and cannot assume a causal link between the attribute and the measurement outcome.

## A new hope

- Psychological measurement is not *hard* measurement, but nevertheless measurement in a weaker sense.

- Soft measurement must be understood on its own terms as something distinct from hard measurement.

- Focus on the specific features of soft measurement, without trying to force psychological measurement into the mold of hard measurement.

## Validity

- Psychological measurements can have a degree of validity for certain intended uses or interpretations.

- It does not mean validity in the causal sense.

- Intelligence test scores can be valid to predict academic achievement but might not justify the existence of an underlying latent variable.

## Prediction without a causal link

- Prediction is possible purely based on (noncausal) correlations.

- Ambiguous concepts can be useful for prediction as long as they are correlated with the cause of what is being predicted.

- Emphasis on the qualitative aspects of measurement:
  - intended uses;
  - evidences;
  - conceptualization.
  
## Conclusion

- Psychological measurement is fundamentally different from measurement in the physical sciences but can nevertheless be useful.

- We should approach soft measurement not only with statistical tools but with conceptual and qualitative approaches.
